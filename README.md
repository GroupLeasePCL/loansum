# Introducing loansum
Loansum is the introductory open source offering from
SyndLoanHub, LLC. Loansum is the first open source Java library designed to accurately model syndicated loan
cash flows and valuation. Financial software developers can use loansum to construct or extend applications
with genuine syndicated loan support.

# loansum is open source
Native loan software is notoriously complex and expensive. Only a handful of software vendors model loans
accurately with enough support to produce detailed cash flows with accompanying explanations. Loansum was
developed to establish a free and open source library around which a community of stakeholders could evolve
to continuously extend the software over time. Loansum is released as Open Source Software under the
Apache v2.0 license. This is a widely used, business-friendly, license.

# Strata foundation 
The design and implementation of loansum is based on Strata, the award-winning open source analytics 
and market risk library from OpenGamma. Loansumâ€™s Strata foundation lays the groundwork for providing future
versions of loansum that include sophisticated market risk analytics by projecting future bank loan cash
flows and evaluating credit spread and interest rate scenarios.
