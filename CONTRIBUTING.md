# Contributing to loansum
At this time, although loansum 0.1 is public, the project
is not prepared to accept direct contributions via issues,
pull requests, etc. Our goal is to solidify the initial
functionality and complete the [loansum.org](https://loansum.org)
site and documentation.

However, any comments on the project would be
greatly appreciated, particularly regarding:
- Observed defects
- Potential usage of the library
- Feature requests

All comments and questions should be emailed to <info@loansum.org>. Thanks so much
for your feedback!
